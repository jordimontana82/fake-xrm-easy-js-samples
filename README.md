# fakexrmeasy.js and xrm-mock samples

Welcome!

This project basically shows how to combine xrm-mock and fakexrmeasy.js together for client-side unit testing.

Installing & Building & Running tests
====================================

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run test


The repo is already preconfigured to use jest for testing. You should be able to run them via npm run test after installing packages and building the project.

It is also very handy to use these VS Code extensions to have live unit tests running as well as a test explorer UI.

- Jest: Open up VS Code, go search for the extension "Jest".
- Test Explorer UI: In VS Code, search "Test Explorer UI" and then install it.
- Jest Test Explorer: In VS Code, search for "Jest Test Explorer" and install it.
